# Outlander

> Unorthodox and opinionated code style for modern JS and TS

This is my personal approach to code style. All opinions here are based on long-term observation and practice. This work is an attempt to create a balanced and aesthetic code style where statements are highly independent and stylistic noise is reduced. It also provides regular structure for better greppability. It is mostly close to Allman Style. I think the only way for curly-brace-based syntaxes is to keep opening and closing braces at the same level. But you can't find a lot of code styles with this idea. That's why Outlander came in.
